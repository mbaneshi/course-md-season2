In the preceding lesson, we delved into the memory layout and instantiation of TVM. Now, let's explore the process of message handling and understand what a transaction truly entails. To initiate any change in the state of a contract, it must receive a single message, referred to as an incoming message. There are two types of incoming messages: external and internal.

An external message is essentially a data string that originates seemingly from nowhere, at least from the blockchain's perspective. This data lacks inherent authentication and doesn't carry any monetary value in the form of tone coins. Its content can vary, determined by the contract author. The contract's responsibility is to interpret and parse this data within its code.

On the other hand, internal messages are those sent by contracts to other contracts. These messages possess a more structured format. Firstly, internal messages can include balances, allowing contracts to attach any amount of coins when sending a message to another contract. Secondly, these messages are securely authenticated by the sending contract's address, a crucial aspect of authentication in later lessons.

Upon receiving a message, a contract may have separate handlers for internal and external messages. Both message types carry arbitrary payload data defined by the contract author. If a contract intends to process different message types, it utilizes op codes, denoted by a four-byte prefix in the message's custom data, indicating the supported operation type.

So, what is a transaction? A transaction represents a series of state changes in a contract. The message serves as an input to the transaction, while the transaction itself, through TVM operations, alters the state and generates a new state for the contract, along with a list of outgoing actions.

There are five phases in a transaction:

1. **Storage Phase:** The blockchain charges the contract rent for its existence during this phase. Rent is computed as a price per bit per second, deducted from the contract's balance. If the contract runs out of money at this point, the execution aborts.

2. **Credit Phase:** Coins attached to incoming messages are credited to the contract during this phase. External messages lack coins, but internal messages typically carry them.

3. **Computation Phase:** This is where the program executes, with TVM verifying each operation and tracking gas usage. Gas limits can be set by the program designer.

4. **Action Phase:** The new state of the contract is a key action in this phase. Other actions include outgoing messages to other contracts, defining interactions.

5. **Bounce Phase:** In case of failure and a bounceable message flag, any remaining money triggers the contract to create an outgoing message back to the sender, a safety feature allowing fund recovery in case of errors.

In summary, a contract receives incoming messages, internal or external, processes them through five transaction phases, and produces a new state along with outgoing actions. This comprehensive overview outlines the intricate journey of messages and transactions in TVM. Thank you.
