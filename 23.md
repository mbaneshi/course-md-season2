So far, we've delved into the memory layout and the anatomy of transactions. Now, let's shift our focus to message authentication in contracts. In this session, I'll discuss four distinct categories of authentication. The first method involves simple classic authentication using a signature.

As a quick recap, any event in the TON blockchain initiates with an external message. These external messages, initially unauthenticated data, typically land in wallet contracts associated with individual users. The wallet's primary functions include storing TON coin balances, managing sequence numbers to prevent message replay, and storing public keys. When an external message arrives, the wallet reads the 64-byte signature, verifies it with the stored public key, and interprets the remaining message as instructions for internal contract communication.

It's essential to reserve this classic authentication for wallets to enhance system composability and flexibility. The second authentication mechanism centers on authenticating the message sender for internal messages within the TON ecosystem. Each internal message carries a guaranteed and secure message sender identity, simplifying the verification process. This approach is more cost-effective and powerful than relying on signatures, enabling flexibility in connecting various contracts.

The third authentication method builds upon the message sender concept by utilizing cryptographic hashes of contract code and data. TON ecosystem addresses not only serve as unique identifiers but also secure hashes. This enables a "DNA check," allowing contracts to authenticate communication by confirming that the sender executed their part of the protocol correctly.

Lastly, the fourth type of authentication emphasizes the deliberate lack of authentication. In certain scenarios, not authenticating messages becomes a security measure. For instance, in a decentralized staking pool requiring censorship resistance, a message handler could forego authentication, allowing anyone to trigger the message while incorporating other protective measures.

In summary, TON employs four authentication types: external signature-based authentication, internal authentication by message sender, DNA checks for code/data verification, and intentional lack of authentication for specific use cases requiring censorship resistance. Each method serves distinct purposes in building secure and flexible decentralized applications.
